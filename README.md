Code and images used to create my poster for the CSEE conference in Sherbrooke, QC, in July 2025. This code made use of the [posterdown](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown) package, using a heavily customized variant of the [template HTML file](https://github.com/mcoghill/CSEE2025/blob/main/etc/template.html) for this particular poster. To recreate this poster, you must first install the custom HTML file into your posterdown package folder (`<path_to_R_packages/posterdown/rmarkdown/templates/posterdown_betterland/resources/template.html`). Alternatively, you may also run [line 85 in the Coghill_M_Poster_Plots.R](https://github.com/mcoghill/CSEE2025/blob/ed1692ed1d689d79763665f391757ef1a1c0d2e6/Coghill_M_Poster_Plots.R#L85) file to copy this file to that directory (note: based on a Windows OS file path). 

Code is provided for generating the figures; however, the size of the CSV files is too large for uploading to GitHub. If interested in recreating these figures from the data itself, please reach out to for those data files, though the images are provided in the [images folder](https://github.com/mcoghill/CSEE2025/tree/main/images) as well.

Note that I made use of the [Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab) font style for this project. This font style matches TRU's serif font style as of July 2025 ([see here](https://www.tru.ca/marcom/downloads.html#fonts)). You'll need to install this font on your system if you have not already done so, and ensure that R is able to use it by loading the [extrafont](https://github.com/wch/extrafont) package and running [lines 5-8 in the Coghill_M_Poster_Plots.R](https://github.com/mcoghill/CSEE2025/blob/ed1692ed1d689d79763665f391757ef1a1c0d2e6/Coghill_M_Poster_Plots.R#L5C1-L8C12) file.

Creating this poster was a very interesting excercise, however I would caution users creating their own posters and plainly state that this process took a lot more time and effort to create compared to other mainstream methods using some sort of GUI.
